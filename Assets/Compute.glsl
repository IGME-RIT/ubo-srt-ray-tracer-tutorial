Description:
This program serves to demonstrate the concept of ray tracing. This
builds off a previous Intermediate Ray Tracer, adding in reflections. 
There are four point lights, specular and diffuse lighting, and shadows. 
It is important to note that the light positions and triangles being 
rendered are all hardcoded in the shader itself. Usually, you would 
pass those values into the Fragment Shader via a Uniform Buffer.

WARNING: Framerate may suffer depending on your hardware. This is a normal 
problem with Ray Tracing. If it runs too slowly, try removing the second 
cube from the triangles array in the Fragment Shader (and also adjusting 
NUM_TRIANGLES accordingly). There are many optimization techniques out 
there, but ultimately Ray Tracing is not typically used for Real-Time 
rendering.
